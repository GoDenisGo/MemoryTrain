    <h1>Welcome to the Short-term Memory Game. Have you got what it takes?</h1>

    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <p>A string of text will flash on the screen for a certain interval.</p>
    <p>Your job will be to recall all the characters of the text and type them in. </p>
    <p>The game will become progressively more difficult as the length of the text increases.</p>

    <p>If you think you have what it takes to beat the challenge, then try it now... Good luck!</p>
